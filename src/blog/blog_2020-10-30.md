# Learning Ansible

**Published:** *10/30/2020*

This week I messed around with `Ansible`, a tool that helps configure infrastructure through a *Push* methodology.

## Installing Ansible
Installing **Ansible** was an easy process since I was already on a **Linux Distro** and had to type a simple command to *fetch* the package using `apt`. I used the [documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) Ansible provided to run these commands on my system. 

1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt install software-properties-common`
3. `sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible`
4. `sudo apt install ansible`

During the installation process, Ansible pre-installs **Python** since it's a dependency required to run the tool. One thing to point out is that if you have any issues during the installation, make sure you follow these commands to help you install the proper pre-requisites. 

## Ansible Overview
Ansible runs on **playbooks** that are made through a `.yaml` file. These playbooks are configured to run specific **tasks** with the help of the [Ansible modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/list_of_all_modules.html). Ansible contains many modules to assist in delivering a full suite of tools for your playbook, each module contains **parameters** that can be defined in the playbook tasks. Another intersting thing I've learned from ansbile is that it handles many **native** Operating System features like **permissions** within the playbook configuration. 

## Configuring Ansible
A quirk I noticed while working with a playbook is to make sure you indicate on the starting like the `---`, denoting the start of the playbook file. Another thing to note is **spacing matters** a lot with the playbook since **Python** is ran under the hood with ansible. With that said, I wanted to configure a test web-server enviornment and a few of my requirements were as follows.

1. Spin up and configure an **Apache** webserver
2. Clone a GitHub Repository
3. Install all required packages/dependencies

With these requirements, each ansible *module* has parameters that can be used inside each playbook task to run for your specific needs. I first used the `apt` module to install all the required services to manage my webserver running a **LAMP** stack. The second module I used was the `git` module to clone my repository from **GitHub** into my required directory. For security purposes I updated the permissions using the `file` module to update the **user group** & **permission value**. Finally I used some *built-in*'s from Ansible to help configure the rest of my settings for my web-server. I loved how easy it was to configure a playbook for my use-case inside Ansible with the wide array of modules provided.
