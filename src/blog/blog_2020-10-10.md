# Discord Python Notification Bot

**Published:** *10/10/2020*

This week I modified a `python` bot to automatically notify anyone in my `discord` server that an *event* is ongoing. I also took some time to get more use to `figma`'s tools and generated a wireframe for an upcomming project I am working on.

## Automating a Python Discord Bot for Events
I continue my journey with automation by modifying a previous bot I worked on to automatically alert everyone in my **discord** channel when an event is started. In my channel we decided during this pandemic that we would have an *open video call* for anyone wanting to join to just relax and hangout in a video call. My bots purpose was to help automate such process by notifying everyone when the event has started and unlock the special video channel for people to join. I used an open connection to check for when the `currentDateTime` is equal to the `postedDateTime` of the event is through `.env` files for code portability and customization. I dug a little deeper in the **discord.py** library and used a method to automatically lock and unlock the channel when the event is triggered.

## Wireframing a New Project w/ Figma

I recently started a new project with my group members in school and got the chance to build a **wireframe** for a proposed **web-application**. I learned a lot more about the tooling offered on **Figma** and was able to set-up a *"Deisgn System"* where you can specify re-usable components or properties like colors! I researched more *color theory* and what types of colors definitions are there such as *Primary, Secondary, Accents, Tertiary*. Through the use of these color & design systems, we were able to build a *design guideline* for our web-application.
