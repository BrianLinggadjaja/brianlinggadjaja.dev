# Testing Nginx

**Published:** *10/02/2020*

This week I installed & configured `Nginx`, which is a lightweight blazing fast `Apache` webserver alternative.

## Installed & Configured my first Nginx Webserver

It was so easy to install, I quickly span up a **docker container** based off **Ubuntu:latest** and with one simple install command `apt-get install nginx` it ran through the inital setup for **Nginx**. Right after the initial setup I was able to view on my browser the _Nginx_ landing page.

Installation was super simple but the hardest part of webservers is **configuration**. I looked through the _Nginx_ **documentation** and tried to find settings I think would fit my **core requirements** of how I want to use _Nginx_. Another resource I used was **searching** `"Nginx best practices"` & `"Nginx security configuration"` on my search engine for what type of best practices I should implement within my _Nginx_ configuration. A few configurations I found from my learning were `server_tokens: off`, `HSTS Strict Transport Security`, & follow general **principle of least privledge** practices.

Overall `Nginx` was a new and great experience. I will definetly delve deeper in how to better configure and manage an _Nginx_ webserver in the future.
