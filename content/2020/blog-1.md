This week I developed my skills with `docker compose` and learned `Python` for the first time to make a pull request on my friends **discord bot** that notifies our friend group when an upcoming birthday is through an `iCal` python library, `Discord SDK` for building a bot, and played around with `Electron.js` which allows code compiling for **Progressive Web Apps** (_PWA_) to be run on **many operating systems**.

## Learning more about Docker Compose

I was able to make my `docker container` easily deployable and have a faster setup time through simple commands like `docker-compose up -d` & `docker-compose down` through a DockerFile than manually building a container via `docker cli`. I played more around modifying and understanding how the overall docker build process works with _DockerFile_'s.

## Learning Python & Building a Discord Bot

For the first time ever I learned python and it only took a couple of days to get enough knowledge to build new features using `Python 3`. That's a true testiment to how easy and accessible the python language is. I worked on additional code **portability** & **notification/output** on a `discord bot` that displays **birthdays** via command or **CRON** scheduling using the imported **iCal** file as a _datasource_.
