This week I developed my skills with `docker compose` and learn `Python` for the first time to make a pull request on my friends **discord bot** that notifies our friend group when an upcoming birthday is through an `iCal` python library & `Discord SDK` to utilize **asyncronus** code to post updates to our channel in a timely manner.

I was able to make my `docker container` easily deployable and have a faster setup time through simple commands like `docker-compose up -d` & `docker-compose down` through a DockerFile than manually building a container via `docker cli`. I added extra code portability to an existing repo made by my friend and I.
